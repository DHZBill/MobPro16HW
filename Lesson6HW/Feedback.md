Overall, I like the kind of questions you asked. They are diverse and explored different aspects of design.

Your findings for question #2 (When I tap the upper right next to...) is good. 
Your reasoning seems sound; it is convinient to reply to friends reacting to their statuses. 
You mentioned that the feature will fit better in the Friends fragment. 
A couple of more sentences on where in the Friends fragment and how would this feature be displayed.

For #4 (Is it easy to find and edit my profile...), the users have to do a lot more work (scrolling) in order to get to their more important stuff.

Using and citing some of the Android Design Principles will support your arguments better.

**Your Design**

I like the reduction in the number of tabs. 
You also removed the Messenger icon. Decluttering and simplifying is always a good move. 
What happens when someone is trying to message within the app? 
Will there be an option available to view and send messages within the app? 
It can be annoying that Facebook wants you to have multiple apps for different parts.

You removed the profile element and moved others to the bottom of the screen. 
How are users going to post statuses? Do they type somewhere else?

Your work on the Settings page is excellent. Grouping similar items and organizing the tab! Looks great. Did you intentionally make those color choices? Any particular reason why they are different from Facebook's usual blue and white?
